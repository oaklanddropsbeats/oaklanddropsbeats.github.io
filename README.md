<h2>Oakland Drops Beats</h2>

<h3>One day. One crawl. Bringing together downtown Oakland's music, commerce, and people. </h3>

The vision is to have a day in downtown Oakland where music comes from every block, and people gather in every participating storefront. Imagine a whole day in which a handfull of designated venues host music, and Oakland's people are able to walk along their sidewalks and experience the epic music being created in this city.
It will be centered around the 14th and 15th street areas between Webster and Broadway, with venues that include galleries, music venues, parkinglots and more.

The first day that the music will be dropped is scheduled for: <h4><b>Saturday, April 19th 2014.</b> </h4>

<b>Bring your moms, dogs, friends, foes, and ideas.</b>

This is the platform for the ODB website that will eventually be launched at 
http://oaklanddropsbeats.com and will have updates on everything you need to know about the event.

If you have ideas, or want to send a personal message, you can contact angelicatavella@gmail.com.
